## Introduction

This Landing Page has been developed for Udacity's "Front End Web Developer Nanodegree" and uses JavaScript to create an interactive navigational experience for the user.

## Requirements

This project should be a multi-section landing page that adds the navigational items dynamically, depending on the page sections. The section that is actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. Also, when a user clicks a navigation element, the element should scroll the user to the appropriate section.

## Extras

This landing page hides the navigation bar while the user is not scrolling after two seconds. A scroll-to-the-top button is visible when the user scrolls below the page's fold and disappears when the page reaches the top.

## Git

Although it was not a requirement of the project, this page uses Git to save the project's files and any information about them.
